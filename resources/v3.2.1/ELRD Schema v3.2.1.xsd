The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.'

For avoidance of doubt, the word 'relationships' is used throughout this document as a synonym for an object property. This vocabulary does not cover the societal relationships that an individual person has with, for example, other members of their family or their employer. The concern here is with the key aspects that define the natural person. The dividing line between describing a natural person and describing their identity is imprecise and some properties that the working group felt were 'just' out of scope are among those discussed in section 6. The data type properties of the Person class do not have any cardinality restrictions and as such all are optional.

In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal. Again referring to the example of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's, the patronymic name element would be unused [ISA core person vocabulary]."</xs:documentation>

The Full Name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements. It is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.

The Full Name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements. It is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once.

Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once.

The Full Name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements. It is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.  Note that the vocabulary provides an Alternative Name property. This allows name(s) to be recorded that have no legal status but that nevertheless are the names by which an individual is generally known."</xs:documentation>

It is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.

A restriction can imply either a prohibition or a limitation for the proprietor or for his/her power of disposal with respect to such property or LR Unit. Restrictions can be absolute or relative, indefinite or for a specified period and it may be absolute or conditional on something happening. As a matter of principle, restrictions should be established by courts, although in some legal systems there are governmental bodies which have similar competence in this issue. The purpose of restrictions is to regulate registration. A restriction makes it apparent from the register that either the powers of the relevant proprietor are limited, or that a prior condition must be met so as to allow a registration. In principle, once entered, a restriction will remain in the register until it is cancelled or withdrawn. In the IMOLA field, “restrictions” mean primally judicial restrictions, that is to say, established by courts, although also others which can be assimilated to them according to the legal system that created them. Conventionally, “notices” would be the class of registrations devoted to entering judicial restrictions. Restrictions related to the person of the proprietor should be within the scope of Section “B”. Restrictions which fall specifically upon a property or LR Unit should be taken to Section “C” –Subsection “Notices of restrictions”–."</xs:documentation>

The Full Name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements. It is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.  Note that the vocabulary provides an Alternative Name property. This allows name(s) to be recorded that have no legal status but that nevertheless are the names by which an individual is generally known."</xs:documentation>

Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.' Best Practice for recording various other status levels is to use the relevant jurisdiction's terms and to identify the controlled vocabulary used. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered.

In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.' Best Practice for recording various other status levels is to use the relevant jurisdiction's terms and to identify the controlled vocabulary used. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

Familiar types are SA, PLC, LLC, GmbH etc. At the time of publication, there is no agreed set of company types that crosses borders. The term 'SA' is used in Poland and France for example although they mean slightly different things. The UK's LLP and Greece's EPE provide further example of close, but not exact, matches.That said, each jurisdiction will have a limited set of recognised company types and these should be used in a consistent manner. It is to be hoped that further work can be carried out in this area in the near future. For now, the company type and the vocabulary from which the term comes should be recorded.

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

Iceland does not have a concept of 'family name' in the way that many other European countries do, for example. Erik Magnusson and Erika Magnusdottir are siblings, both offspring of Mangnus, irrespective of his patronymic name. In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal. Again referring to the example of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's, the patronymic name element would be unused [ISA core person vocabulary]."</xs:documentation>

Erik Magnusson and Erika Magnusdottir are siblings, both offspring of Mangnus, irrespective of his patronymic name. In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal. Again referring to the example of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's, the patronymic name element would be unused [ISA core person vocabulary]."</xs:documentation>

The Full Name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements. It is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.

Iceland does not have a concept of 'family name' in the way that many other European countries do, for example. Erik Magnusson and Erika Magnusdottir are siblings, both offspring of Mangnus, irrespective of his patronymic name. In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal. Again referring to the example of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's, the patronymic name element would be unused [ISA core person vocabulary]."</xs:documentation>

In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal.

Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.

Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.'

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

Again, at the time of publication, there is no agreed vocabulary for recording the status of a company although XBRL Europe [xEBR] is in the process of defining such a vocabulary. Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.' Best Practice for recording various other status levels is to use the relevant jurisdiction's terms and to identify the controlled vocabulary used. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

Common Law Jurisdictions of the European Union also have a notarial profession whose practice extends across a wide range of legal services and whose functions and authority are principally exercised in relation to legal acts and instruments to be used in overseas jurisdictions. They have a significant role in the international trade and commerce of their domestic jurisdiction. Notaries’ tasks in particular are a) to draw up private agreements and to advise the parties while satisfying an obligation to treat each of them fairly. In drafting official documents, the notary is responsible for the legality of these documents and for the advice s/he gives. S/he has to inform the parties of the implications and consequences of the obligations they undertake, b) to enforce the deeds s/he draws up. The deed can then be registered directly in the official records, or enforced if one of the parties does not meet its obligations, without the prior intervention of a judge, c) to play the role of an arbitrator who, impartially, and under strict observance of the law, enables the parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement [e-Justice]."</xs:documentation>

In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal.

Again, at the time of publication, there is no agreed vocabulary for recording the status of a company although XBRL Europe [xEBR] is in the process of defining such a vocabulary. Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.'

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal.

Taking the existing XBRL work as a starting point, however, the term 'Normal Activity' does appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used in preference to terms like 'trading' or 'operating.'

The Legal Identifier is therefore a fundamental relationship between a legal entity and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the  Identifier class. The Core vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain.The cardinality of this relationship is 1..1, i.e. a legal entity shall have a unique legal identifier and a legal identifier shall identify only one legal entity.In RDF terms, legalIdentifier is a sub property of identifier (see next section) with specific semantics.RationaleCore Vocabularies do not normally demand that any specific field (property/relationship) is defined. However, a legal entity can only have that status if it is given by a suitable authority. Therefore the working group resolved that a Legal Entity Class could not sensibly be defined without the legal identifier. (ISA core vocabulary)"</xs:documentation>

In Bulgaria and Russia, patronymic names are in every day usage, for example, the Sergeyevich in 'Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.' Note that patronymic names refer to a father's given name, not the family name inherited from the mother and father as is the case in countries such as Spain and Portugal.

Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true.

In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point.
